Create a separate SELECT statement to retrieve all the rows and columns from each of the tables.

SELECT * FROM player;
SELECT * FROM team;
SELECT * FROM batting;
SELECT * FROM roster;
*/
/*
Create a SELECT statement that joins the batting table to the team table like this:
SELECT team.ID, 
team.teamName,
batting.teamID,
batting.rank,
batting.battingAvg 
FROM team INNER JOIN batting ON team.ID = batting.teamID
*/

/*
Create a SELECT statement that joins the batting table to the player table. Which player has a batting average of 331?
SELECT  player.ID,
player.lastName,
batting.ID,
batting.rank,
batting.battingAvg
FROM player
INNER JOIN batting on player.ID = batting.playerID WHERE batting.battingAvg = 331

SELECT player.ID,
player.lastName,
roster.playerID,
player.bats, roster.position
FROM player
INNER JOIN roster ON player.ID = roster.playerID
INNER JOIN team ON team.ID = roster.teamID WHERE team.teamName = 'Boston Red Sox';

A View is virtual table in that it contains rows of data from other tables and view.

The baseball database contains a couple of views. One of them is named vTeamRoster. 
The vTeamRoster view joins the roster, team, and player tables together. Execute the following statement:

SELECT * FROM vTeamRoster;
*/

/*
Execute the following statement to display the columns used within the view:
DESCRIBE vTeamRoster;
*/


/*
Execute the following statement display the sql statement that makes up the view: 
SHOW CREATE VIEW vTeamRoster;
*/
